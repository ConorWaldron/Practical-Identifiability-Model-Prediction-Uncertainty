This folder contains all files related to practical model identifiability and model prediction uncertainty. These files are offline only, they are not meant to be used with LabVIEW. They most often only use simulated data instead of real data. The simulated data can be created by a number of different methods including factorial designs, latin squares or MBDoE.
