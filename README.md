This folder contains all files related to practical model identifiability and model prediction uncertainty. These files are offline only, they are not meant to be used with LabVIEW. They most often only use simulated data instead of real data. The simulated data can be created by a number of different methods including factorial designs, latin squares or MBDoE.

The files are divided repeated once for SA and once for Amb. SA refers to the sulfuric acid case study which is a two parameter model for the homogenous esterification of benzoic acid and ethanol using sulfuric acid catalyst in a PFR. Amb refers to the Amberlyst case study which is a 2/3/4 parameter model for the hetereogenous esterification of benzoic acid and ethanol using the Amberlyst-15 catalyst in a string reactor.
